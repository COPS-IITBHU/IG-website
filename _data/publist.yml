  description: This is an implementation of Communication in MARL using Graph Neural Network. This is been trained and tested on StarCraft II, And this has shown improved training and performance metrics throughout all the maps. I have implemented this on top of PyMARL for easier comparative study with respect to other algorithms or implementations like ePyMARL.

  description: In this paper, we focus on hate speech detection in multi-modal memes wherein memes pose an interesting multi-modal fusion problem. We try to solve the Facebook Meme Challenge which aims to solve a binary classification problem of predicting whether a meme is hateful or not.Here we explore the visual modality using object detection and image captioning models to fetch the “actual caption” and then combine it with the multi-modal representation to perform binary classification.
