It is the annual technological competition organized by the Indian Institutes of Technology and qualifies as the only technical event wherein all the IITs participate.

Tech Meet tries to involve students to work on real life problems pertaining to local issues and areas which require attention but are not extensively addressed through different platforms.


**Motivation**
Inter IIT Tech Meet is a consequence of students of various IITs coming together envisioning a progressive India. We know that there are countless problems which our country faces due to its population, geographic expanse, climate, infrastructure etc.

**Experience** 
Inter IIT tech meet 10.0 held in 2022 ended with a blast with our teams outshining the rest in many events. We bagged the silver medal in it.
The whole process from getting selected for the inter-IIT team to representing the college at IIT Kharagpur was a great learning process for all the participants,  here we have tried to present a glimpse of inter IIT as the last year's participants talk about their journey and experiences.
