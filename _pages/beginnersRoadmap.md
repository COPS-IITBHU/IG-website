Hola Amigos freshers,
<br>
“Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data science”
All these words sound so fascinating and overwhelming. But to have the right start you need to first understand the differences between the three, explore them and discover your interest!

P.S. Go step by step. We have attached video links alongside.

Inorder to understand in depth each of them, choose the one excites you the most or understand them and decide.
<b>By the end of this section you need to choose one to begin</b>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
Artificial intelligence is a broad area of computer science that makes machines seem like they have human intelligence.

Example: If you have ever asked Alexa to order your food or browse Netflix movie suggestions, you are interacting with AI without realizing it!
<br><b>Link </b>: [What Is Artificial Intelligence? | Artificial Intelligence (AI) In 10 Minutes | Edureka - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV74Najm6Nc)
<br><br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Machine Learning</h3>
Machine learning is a thing-labeler where you explain your task with examples instead of instructions.
The concept behind Machine Learning is that you feed data to machines and let them learn on their own without any human intervention (in the process of learning).

Examples: Classifying whether the image is of cat or dog. (Stay tuned, you’ll be able to do it yourself very soon)

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Data Science</h3>
Data science is a field focused on discovering actionable insights from large sets of raw data.
Data scientists use different techniques to get answers incorporating computer science, analysis, statistics, and machine learning on massive datasets to establish solutions to problems.

Example: Determining who died and who survived in Titanic sinking using dataset, (You’ll do this very soon)

# Roadmap: Data Science
<br>
<h4><b>Step 1:</b></h4> We highly recommend you to use Google Colab. However you can use Jupyter Notebook too.
<br><b>Link:</b> [Google Colab Tutorial for Beginners | Using google Colab for machine learning and Deep learning - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xt6L1I5jSc)
<br><b>Link to Google Colab:</b> [Welcome To Colaboratory - Colaboratory (google.com)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/prites18/NoteNote/blob/master/Welcome_To_Colaboratory.ipynb)
(Watch the video to learn basics on how to use Colab)
<br>
<h4><b>Step 2:</b></h4> Learn the basics of Python to get started.

P.S. This is very important! Python is the most used language for ML/AI ( Although it can be done in other languages, we highly highly recommend you to use Python).

P.S. If you are already well versed with Python, feel free to skip this part.

<br>
<b>Top Tip: 1. Watch ONLY video number 2-9.</b>
<br>
<b>2. Try out everything on Colab yourself.</b>
<br>
<h4><b>Step 3:</b></h4> For Data Science, python has some specific libraries that will help you to make all your tasks easier.
Do Learn each of them.
<b>Pandas:</b>

<b>Matplotlib:</b>
<br><b>Link:</b> [[Hindi] Python Matplotlib Tutorial - Python Data Science and Big Data Tutorials - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFsRLjSc8GA)
<br>
<h4><b>Step 4:</b></h4><h4> Now since you </h4>are done with understanding libraries. These libraries help you in not only working on the dataset but also understanding the dataset. Data Visualization plays a key role in Data science.

<br><b>Link:</b>
[Data Visualization | Data Visualization Python | Intellipaat - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YWwU-gJI5U<b>)

<b>Exercise:</b> In the above video they have used ‘Iris dataset’ as an example for visualizing the dataset. Your task is to use the famous ‘Titanic dataset’ for the same.

How to download?
Go to the link [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)
Make an account on Kaggle. Accept to Join the Competition.
Click below on ‘Download All’.

After trying it yourself. Watch the video below.
<b>Solution: Link:</b>  [Python pandas—Visualization Exercises—Titanic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBT0buoF_Ns)

P.S. A lot more can be done. This is an example.
<br>
<h4><b>Step 5:</b> </h4>In order to predict our result from a dataset. Machine Learning uses different learning algorithms to make the task efficient. These are present pre-built in scikit-learn library.
However it is equally important to understand the math behind it.

There are many learning algorithms. Here we will learn two beginner friendly ones:

- Linear Regression

<br><b>Link:</b> [Lecture 2.1 — Linear Regression With One Variable | Model Representation — Andrew Ng - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHwlB_j7Hkc&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN&index=4)
(Watch videos from 2.1 to 2.7 from the playlist & Do not skip any of them)
- Logistic Regression for Classification problems
<br><b>Link:</b> [Lecture 6.1 — Logistic Regression | Classification — — [ Machine Learning | Andrew Ng] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-la3q9d7AKQ&list=PLNeKWBMsAzboR8vvhnlanxCNr2V7ITuxy)
(Watch the videos from 6.1 to 6.7 from the playlist & Do not skip any of them)

<br>
<h4><b>Step 6:</b> </h4>After understanding the theory behind the algorithms, it is equally important to be able to implement it for data science. Now it’s your time to code!

Implementation of Linear Regression: <br><b>Link:</b> [Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 3: Linear Regression Multiple Variables - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_LnPL3Qg70)

Implementation of Logistic Regression: <br><b>Link:</b>[Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 8: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM4VZR0px8E) (DO NOT watch entire video.
Time stamp: 8:18  to 14:33)

<br>
<b>Top Tip:</b> While watching the video, try to implement yourself on Colab simultaneously. Remember you can’t learn it until you do it yourself.

<br>
<h4><b>Step 7:</b> </h4>Let’s get your hands dirty. Solve the ‘Titanic dataset challenge’ yourself and take your first step to become a data scientist!

<b>Hint:</b> Titanic dataset uses Logistic Regression.

<b>Message:</b> You learn only by competing in data science competitions. Titanic dataset is beginner friendly and solutions can be easily found online. You’ll be surprised to see how quickly and accurately you’ll be able to determine whether the person survived the sinking! IT’S LIKE MAGIC. Try it and share your score on ML discord channel.

<h4><b>Step 7:</b> </h4>Now we are jumping onto something very important in ML.The NEURAL NETWORKS!!

### What is CNN?
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.

CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vision that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).
